'''An abstract method area() (no implementation).
Create two child classes that inherit from Shape:
Rectangle → has attributes length, breadth, and implements area().
Circle → has attribute radius, and implements area().
Task:
Define the abstract class Shape using the abc module.
Implement Rectangle and Circle classes by providing their own version of area().
Create one object of Rectangle and one of Circle, then display their areas.
