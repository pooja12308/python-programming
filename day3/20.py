'''You are building a Library Management System in Python. The system should store books in a dictionary where:
Key → Book ID
Value → Book Title
Write a Python program to perform the following operations using Dictionaries:
Add a book to the library (Book ID, Title).
Remove a book using Book ID.
Search for a book by Book ID and display the title.
Update the title of a book (e.g., correction in title).
Display all books in the library.
Count the total number of books in the library.
Check if a book title exists in the library (reverse lookup).'''
